in some issues one of them is mentioned below:
    Your Settings page already has the shop details:
        Business name
        Address
        Phone / WhatsApp number
        Email address
        Whenever you create or print a bill, the system should automatically use these details on the bill.
        In the Sales window (daily sales – only 24 hours)
        Bill Number box
        There should be a box (QLineEdit) that shows the current bill number.
        This number is shown automatically by the system.
        After a sale
        When a bill is created and the sale is completed:
        The bill is saved
        The bill number automatically increases
        The QLineEdit updates to show the next bill number
        Print bill button
        Next to the bill number, there should be a Print button.
        Clicking this button prints that bill again.
        This is useful if the customer asks for a duplicate copy.

    I want the bill to be print like below:
                  SALES INVOICE
